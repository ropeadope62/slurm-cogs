# discordcogs

DiscordCogs is a growing collection of modular, purpose-built Python cogs designed to extend and enhance your Discord bot. Each cog adds a self-contained feature — from mini-games and utilities to AI-driven chat tools — built to plug neatly into the Red-DiscordBot framework or any custom Discord.py-based bot with minor adjustments.
